# CAST-384 Block Cipher Implementation

This repository contains a Java-based implementation of the CAST-384 block cipher. The project is structured using Gradle for easy build and dependency management.

## 📌 Project Overview

CAST-384 is a conceptual extension of the CAST block cipher family, intended to demonstrate the principles behind symmetric encryption. This implementation showcases how Feistel networks, custom S-box transformations, and key scheduling are used to perform secure data encryption and decryption on 384-bit blocks.

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment for exploring the design and implementation of symmetric cryptographic algorithms.
